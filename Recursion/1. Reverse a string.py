Recursive approach that returns a new reversed string

'''
Recursive call stack for the word "Input":
Call 1 -> reverseStringRecursive("Input") -> ðŸ‘†Returns: "tupn" + "I". Which is the last paused function call on the call stack.
    Call 2 -> reverseStringRecursive("nput") -> ðŸ‘†Returns: "tup" + "n". Takes "tup" and adds "n" and returns "tupn" to Call 1
        Call 3 -> reverseStringRecursive("put") -> ðŸ‘†Returns: "tu" + "p". Takes "tu" and adds "p" and returns "tup" to Call 2
            Call 4 -> reverseStringRecursive("ut") -> ðŸ‘†Returns: "t" + "u". Takes "t" and adds "u" and returns "tu" to Call 3
                Call 5 -> reverseStringRecursive("t") -> ðŸ‘†Returns "t" to Call 4 because length of string "t" is 1 which is Base Case
